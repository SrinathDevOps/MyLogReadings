Public and private clouds are two different deployment models for cloud computing. Here are examples of each:

Public Cloud:

Amazon Web Services (AWS): AWS is one of the largest and most popular public cloud providers. It offers a wide range of cloud services, including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, and more.

Microsoft Azure: Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform, providing services such as virtual machines, app services, AI and machine learning, and data analytics. It is widely used for hosting Windows-based workloads.

Google Cloud Platform (GCP): GCP offers cloud services and products for computing, storage, data analytics, machine learning, and more. It's known for its data analytics and machine learning capabilities.

IBM Cloud: IBM Cloud provides cloud services like virtual servers, containers, AI, and blockchain. It also offers hybrid cloud solutions for businesses with on-premises infrastructure.

Oracle Cloud: Oracle Cloud offers cloud infrastructure, applications, and platform services. It's known for its database and enterprise software offerings.

Private Cloud:

VMware vSphere: VMware provides virtualization and cloud infrastructure solutions. VMware vSphere is often used to create private clouds within data centers.

OpenStack: OpenStack is an open-source cloud computing platform that allows organizations to build and manage private clouds. It offers compute, storage, and networking services.

Microsoft Azure Stack: Azure Stack is an extension of Azure that enables the creation of private and hybrid clouds. It allows organizations to use Azure services within their own data centers.

HPE Helion: HPE Helion is Hewlett Packard Enterprise's cloud computing solution for building and managing private clouds.

Red Hat OpenShift: OpenShift is an open-source container platform that can be used to build and manage private cloud environments. It's often used for container orchestration and application deployment.

In summary, public clouds are provided by third-party cloud service providers and are accessible to the public over the internet. Private clouds, on the other hand, are dedicated cloud environments used by a single organization and can be hosted on-premises or by a cloud provider. The choice between public and private clouds depends on factors like data security, compliance requirements, and scalability needs. Many organizations also opt for hybrid cloud solutions that combine aspects of both public and private clouds.
